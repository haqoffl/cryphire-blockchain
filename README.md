### ðŸ”’ **Cryphire**

**Cryphire** is a simple DeFi project designed to bridge the gap between beginner and advanced crypto traders.

In this model, beginner (or passive) users can deposit their crypto assets into a shared pool. Experienced traders then use these pooled funds to actively invest in strategies such as Uniswap liquidity provision, token swaps, and yield opportunities. The profits generated are distributed back to the original depositors.

The goal is to make DeFi investing accessible to noobs, while allowing skilled traders to generate returns for both parties.

idea is inspired the mutual fund concept
